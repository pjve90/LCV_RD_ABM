\section{Problem Formulation}

The model design described here is related to the PhD project of Pablo J. Varas Enr√≠quez, and the collaboration of Dr. Dieter Lukas, Dr. Heidi Colleran, and Dr. Monique Borgerhoff Mulder. The model is intended to analyse the interplay of resource acquisition and sharing dynamics, and its influence on the female human life cycle. Specifically, the model intends to analyse variation among individuals in their life cycle stage transition, longevity, and reproductive output and timing.

\emph{APPLICATION? It also includes specification of model outputs, statements of the domain of applicability of the model, as well as the extent by which model outputs may be acceptably extrapolated (Grimm et al. 2014).}

\subsection{Model Purpose}

The female human life cycle is characterised by a long lifespan, within which there is usually a short reproductive period in between long juvenile and post-reproductive stages. The boundaries of the reproductive period, and the frequency at which births occur during this period, are influenced by individual reproductive allocative decisions. Previous work has linked reproductive allocative decisions to the amount of resources available to an individual in its environment or the availability of a network of potential helpers, but how the interplay of both of them change reproductive allocative decisions of an individual remains unclear. Here I develop a theoretical framework to describe how the interplay of resource acquisition and their sharing across the social network may be key to understand female reproductive allocative decisions. More specifically, it allows to analyse different scenarios in which the timing of life cycle stage transition, and reproductive timing and output, might vary.

\subsection{Specify modelling context}

\subsubsection{Model Scope and Scale}

Each iteration in the model represents one year. The probabilities  of producing, receiving, consuming, giving, and storing are binomial, with the values of happening ($1$) or not ($0$). The amount of resources an individual produces, receives, consumes, gives, and store are stage-specific. The number of times an individual receives and gives are also stage-specific . Reproductive effort is evaluated after the resource dynamics, followed by the evaluation for stage transition. Finally, the amount or resources available are stored and passed from one year to the next, being evaluated for survival at the beginning of the iteration.

\subsubsection{Logistical Constraints}

The model should be completed by the beginning of October. Additionally, the model is expected to be flexible enough to quickly adapt for further modifications within the purpose of the model as well as to be used for further theoretical developments.

\subsection{Explain analytical objectives}

The model will be developed in an agent-based model framework, considering that the aims of the model are a) to observe the ages of transition between stages and reproductive behaviour (i.e. reproductive output and timing) that emerge in scenarios with different resource productivity and sharing dynamics, and b) calculate fitness differences associated with the different life cycles that emerge in the different scenarios.

The life cycle of an individual emerge from its behaviour. The life cycle is represented by the timing of the transitions from one life stage to another and its reproductive output and timing, constrained by the stage-specific submodels related to resource acquisition and sharing. Population dynamics also emerge from the behaviour of the individuals. The population dynamics are represented as the age distributions of the life cycle transitions, reproductive output and timing, and surviving individuals.

\subsection{Define candidate actions decisions}

The life cycle and resource dynamics models are based on probability distributions. Therefore, reproductive allostatic decisions are stochastic. Individuals are assumed to know their age, stage, and their current resources available  in order to apply the probabilities of producing, receiving, consuming, giving, losing resources, reproducing, surviving, and transitioning.

\subsection{Specify scenarios}

The scenarios under which the individuals go through their life cycle will be determined by the auxiliary variables that are set for each stage. The values for each variable and stage will be based on previous research (Table \ref{tab:1}. At initialisation, the population will be composed of equal number of individuals per life cycle stage. Additionally, all individuals at initialisation will start with the baseline resources to survive in order to guarantee the survival in the first survival submodel, go through the resource dynamics submodel, and only age after surviving the survival submodel in the next iteration. 

\section{Define Conceptual Model}

Graphically described in Fig. \ref{fig:1}, infant individuals go through survival, receiving, consuming, and storing sub models each year until they transition to the next stage. Once in the juvenile stage, individuals go through survive, produce, receive, consume, give, and store sub models for each year until they reach sexual maturity, transitioning to the adult stage. In the adult stage, individuals also go through surviving, producing, receiving, consuming, giving, and storing sub models until they have their first offspring or reach menopause. If an adult transition to a reproductive career stage, it goes through surviving, producing, receiving, consuming, giving, and storing sub models and also through a reproduction sub model until it reaches menopause. Once in a post-reproductive stage, the individual goes through the surviving, producing, receiving, consuming, giving, and storing sub models of the stage. In each year, the individual increase its age and updates they amount of resources it has. During each transition, the individual updates its stage variable and also transitions with the resources it has available form the earlier stage.

\subsection{Specify key assumptions uncertainties}

Individuals represent females in a single-sex, haploid population. Individuals that are born until they reach \emph{age at transition trait} are considered infants. Juveniles are individuals that transition from infants, until they reach age of sexual maturity. Adults are individuals that have reached sexual maturity until they have their first offspring or reach menopause. Adults transition to a breeder stage once they have their first offspring, and remain in this stage until they reach menopause. From menopause onward individuals are considered post-reproductive.

Individuals are assumed to know their age, stage, and their current resources available  in order to apply the probabilities of producing, receiving, consuming, giving, losing resources, reproducing, surviving, and transitioning.
\\\\
The life cycle and resource dynamics models are based on probability distributions. Therefore, reproductive allostatic decisions are stochastic.

\subsection{Define conceptual model: identify predictor response variables}

\subsubsection{State variables}

Every individual in the simulation is characterised by state variables that are a) calculated new in each iteration, and b) modified from one iteration to the next:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables that are calculated new each iteration:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resources produced: Amount of resources produced by the individual. The amount is fixed to each stage. Therefore, the individual whether produce resources (stage-specific resource production) or not (0) based on a stage-specific production probability specified during initialisation.
        \item Resources received: Amount of resources received by the individual from other individual(s). The amount received by another individual is fixed to each stage. Therefore, the individual receives resources depending on the number of times the stage-specific probability is successful ($1$) or not ($0$), constrained by the stage-specific number of times receiving specified during initialisation.
        \item Resources gave: Amount of resources given by the individual to other individual(s). The amount given to another individual is fixed to each stage. Therefore, the individual gives resources depending on the number of times the stage-specific probability is successful ($1$) or not ($0$), constrained by the stage-specific number of times giving specified during initialisation.
        \item Resources available: Amount of resources an individual has after the dynamics of producing, consuming, giving, receiving, and storing resources. The resources available influence the probabilities for surviving, reproducing, and/or transitioning of an individual and decrease with the costs of each dynamic.
        \item Reproductive effort: Amount of resources the individual uses for reproduction, given the stage-specific probability. The amount is fixed to each stage. Therefore, the individual whether gives birth (stage-specific fertility probability)  or not (0) based on the stage-specific fertility probability and the amount of resources available.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Variables that are modified from one iteration to the next:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Age: Amount of iterations the individual goes through from its birth until it dies. Age increases by one after each iteration, reflecting one year.
        \item Stage: Life cycle stage in which the individual is at the moment. There are five stages (infant, juvenile, adult, breeder, post-reproductive), each with its own stage-specific resource and life-history dynamics. Individual progression through the stages is determined by their age and resources available.
        \item Resources stored: Amount of resources the individual stores for later in time (i.e. next iteration). The amount of resources stored depends on the surplus resources after the stage-specific resource and life-history dynamics. Therefore, the individual whether stores the surplus (stage-specific storing) or loses it (0) based on the stage-specific storing probability. Additionally, stored resources may decay with time.
        \item Reproductive output: Amount of offspring produced, given the stage-specific fertility probability. Reproductive output increases by one after an iteration, if reproductive requirements (i.e. fertility probability and resources available) are met.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Auxiliary variables}

The individual dynamics are constrained by the following auxiliary variables. These variables are stage-specific, set at the initialisation and apply to all individuals in dependence on their state variables.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Die: Probability of dying in the stage. The probability is based on the mortality rates from \cite{gurven2007longevity}, which is adjusted according to the resources available for an individual.
    \item Produce: Probability of producing resources. The probability is based on a binomial distribution regarding whether the individual produces resources ($1$) or not ($0$). The values of the distribution are based on \cite{koster2020life}.
    \item Times receiving: Number of individuals from whom receiving resources. The values can go from zero to the maximum number of individuals available for giving in \cite{gurven2004give}.
    \item Receive: Probability of receiving resources from another individual. The probability is based on a binomial distribution regarding whether the individual receives resources ($1$) or not ($0$) . The values of the distribution are based on \cite{gurven2004give}. The sampling size is defined by the \emph{Times receiving}.
    \item Consume: Amount of resources necessary for somatic maintenance, based on \cite{kaplan2000theory}.
    \item Store: Probability of storing the surplus of resources at the end of an iteration. The probability is based on a binomial distribution regarding whether the individual stores resources ($1$) or not ($0$). The values of the distribution are based on *cross-cultural ref*.
    \item Times giving: Number of times giving resources from other individual(s). The values can go from zero to the maximum number of individuals available for receiving in \cite{gurven2004give}.
    \item Give: Probability of giving resources to another individual. The probability is based on a binomial distribution regarding whether the individual gives resources ($1$) or not ($0$) . The values of the distribution are based on \cite{gurven2004give}. The sampling size is defined by \emph{Times giving}.
    \item Reproduce: Probability of producing an offspring. The probability is based on a stage-specific fertility rate, which is adjusted according to the resources available for an individual.
    \item Transition: Probability of transitioning to the next stage. The transitions are specified as follow:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Infant transition: Reaching the growth and development necessary to transition to the juvenile stage.
        \item Sexual maturity: Reaching the development necessary for menarche and transition to the adult stage.
        \item Reproduce (adult stage): Producing your first offspring and transition to the breeder stage.
        \item Menopause: Reaching the moment where you cannot, biologically, produce more offspring and transition to the post-reproductive stage.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sub models}

Each individual goes through all the stage-specific submodels each iteration.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Infant
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Die: The infant survives by sampling from a *specify distribution* a value equal or higher than the stage-specific survival rate, based on \cite{gurven2007longevity}.

The amount of resources decreases by the costs of survival.
        \item Times receiving: The individual receives resources from a certain number of individuals. This is based on sampling a value between zero and the maximum number of givers in \cite{gurven2004give}, constrained by population size.

        \item Consume: The infant consumes the amount of resources necessary for somatic maintenance from the resources available in the iteration, based on \cite{kaplan2000theory}.
        \item Store: The infant has a probability of storing the surplus of resources available in the iteration by sampling from a binomial distribution. The individual either stores ($1$) or not ($0$), based on the probability on the *population reference*. In case the individual does not store ($0$) then the surplus is lost. Finally, stored resources decay with time.
        \item Transition: The infant transition by sampling from a *specify distribution* a value equal or higher than the stage-specific probability of transition, based on the *population reference*. The infant has a higher chance to transition if it has a larger amount of resources available.

Finally, stored resources decay with time.
        \item Age at sexual maturity: The juvenile transition by sampling from a *specify distribution* a value equal or higher than the stage-specific probability of reaching sexual maturity, based on the *population reference*. The juvenile has a higher chance to be sexually mature if it has a larger amount of resources available.

    \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Age at first reproduction: The adult transition by sampling from a Poisson distribution a value equal or higher than the stage-specific fertility rate, based on the *population reference*.

            \item Menopause: The adult transition by sampling from a *specify distribution* a value equal or higher than the stage-specific probability of menopause, based on the *population reference*.

\subsection{Conceptual model evaluation}

For model testing, the life cycle of the individuals was observed process by process. For model analysis, timing (e.g. longevity, age of transition), reproductive (e.g. number of offspring, timing of reproduction), and resource-related (e.g. production, consumption, giving, receiving, losing) variables were recorded.

\section{Formalise and Specify Model}

\subsection{Choose model class, framework and approach}

Agent-based modelling will be used to develop the theoretical framework intended in this project. First, agent-based model suit the aims of the project since it allows to identify the emergence of patterns and structures (i.e. life cycle, fitness differences) by the interactions of multiple state and auxiliary variables (i.e. resource acquisition and sharing). Second, agent-based models allow to consider heterogeneous individuals in a population, fitting the need of the model to have individuals that interact with individuals at other life cycle stages. Therefore, agent-based modelling fits the needs of the theoretical framework necessary to understand the role of the interplay of resource acquisition and sharing dynamics in the diversity of female human reproductive allocative decisions.

\subsection{Choose model features and family}

\subsubsection{Explain how you will operationalise response variable(s)}

The life cycle of an individual is characterised by longevity, age of transition from one stage to another, number of offspring, and the timing of reproduction. Resource-related variables are related to the auxiliary variables of production, consumption, giving, receiving, and storing.

\subsection{Choose model family}

State and auxiliary variables are based on stage-specific binomial distribution, where it is decided if the individual acts ($1$) or not ($0$). Reproduction is based on stage-specific fertility rates and a Poisson distribution. The values for the distributions are based on references from the literature (Table \ref{tab:1}).

\subsection{Choose approach for identifying model structure and parameters}

\emph{Not sure it applies}

\subsection{Specify model assumptions and uncertainties}

Individuals represent females in a single-sex, haploid population. Individuals that are born until they reach \emph{age at transition trait} are considered infants. Juveniles are individuals that transition from infants, until they reach age of sexual maturity. Adults are individuals that have reached sexual maturity until they have their first offspring or reach menopause. Adults transition to a reproductive career stage once they have their first offspring, and remain in this stage until they reach menopause. From menopause onward individuals are considered post-reproductive.

\subsection{Specify formal model}

\emph{Once critical decisions have been made about the approach and method of model specification,¬¨‚Ä†translate the conceptual model into the quantitative model}

\caption{Life cycle graph of the human life cycle under different combinations of resource dynamics. I is the newborn stage (i.e. infant), J the sexually immature stage (i.e. juvenile), A the reproductive non-breeding stage (i.e. adult), RC the reproductive career stage, and PR the post-reproductive stage. The thick arrows between life cycle stages refers to the transition from one stage to the other. Loop arrows below life cycle stages refers to the probability of staying in that stage. A newborn is produced either when an individual transition from stage A to RC or when an individual remains in stage RC. The dashed arrows refers to the production of offspring in that life cycle. Resource dynamics (P=production, C=consumption, R=resources received, G=resources given away, S=resources stored) that relate to the timing of life cycle stage transition and offspring production and timing are described with thick arrows among the stage-specific resource production (P), consumption (C), receiving (R), giving (G), and storing (S) and the corresponding life cycle stage.}

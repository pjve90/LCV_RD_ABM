# Life cycle variability and resource dynamics ABM

Here you can find all the files related to the modelling project to understand how the life cycle variability at the population level is influenced by the different resource dynamics experienced by the individuals within a female human population.

The written files are developed in LaTeX (Overleaf) and the coding files in R.

These are the following components of the project so far:

- Manuscript draft: Here you can find all the drafts related to a Registered Report and final manuscript of the project.

- Model code: Here you can find all the documents related to the code of the model.

- Other drafts: Here you can find drafts and files related to earlier stages (e.g. reading lists) and presentations in conferences and workshops.

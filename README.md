# Life cycle variability and resource dynamics ABM

Here you can find all the files related to the modelling project to understand how the life cycle variability at the population level is influenced by the different resource dynamics experienced by the individuals within a female human population.

The coding files are developed with the R programming language.

- Model code: Here you can find all the documents related to the code of the model.

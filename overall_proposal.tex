\begin{abstract}
    The female human life cycle has evolved to have a long lifespan with a short reproductive period, within long juvenile and post-reproductive stages. Within these boundaries, humans can present diverse life cycles that can go from long lifespans and low reproductive output (e.g. post-demographic transition Japan) to short lifespans and high number of offspring (e.g. pygmies populations). These differences in the life cycle have been usually associated with the amount of resources that an individual possesses, but the social mechanisms of linking the amount of resources of an individual and changes in its life cycle remain unclear. Here I expect to show that the sociality surrounding resources (i.e. resource-related social mechanisms) may be key to understand the link between the amount of resources and the variations in the female human life cycle. First, this project wants to understand how resource transfers link with the female human life cycle. Afterwards, see how resource transfers fit with other resource-related social mechanisms (i.e. production, consumption, and accumulation) in shaping the female human life cycle. Finally, if the interplay of different types of resources (i.e. material, embodied, and relational) with resource-related mechanisms play different roles across the life cycle. For this, dynamic stochastic programming models will be used to analyse how the sociality surrounding resources shapes the female human life cycle. The results should demonstrate that an individual would move earlier from juvenile to adulthood to increase the amount of receiving resource transfers, despite an increase in giving resources to others; reproduce earlier if it can receive enough resources to buffer the costs of offspring production, and move earlier to a post-reproductive stage if it cannot receive enough resources to buffer the costs of another offspring but individual individual survival can be ensured. Furthermore, the amount of resources an individual receives and accumulates would have a buffering effect on oscillations of resource production across the life cycle, while giving away resources would negatively influence resource consumption and accumulation. Finally, material resource-related mechanisms would play the main role across the life cycle, while oscillations of them are buffered by embodied - while juvenile - and relational - once adult - resource-related mechanisms. In conclusion, not only the amount of resources shape the female human life cycle but also the timing of resource transfers, production, consumption, and accumulation play a role as well. Resource transfers might play a regulatory role in the female human life cycle, where changes on individual production are buffered by resource acquisition via social interactions. This dynamic would also prioritize material resources, which in turn would be buffered by relational and embodied resources.

\section{Introduction}

There are many developmental paths an individual can follow through its life cycle, which is the basis of the diversity seen across the tree of life. The diversity of reproductive schedules can go from a couple to thousands offspring (e.g. eastern hemlock vs rain moth \citep{tindale1932revision,van2017lifetime} and mortality ones from lifespans of days to thousands of years (e.g. hairyback vs patagonian cypress \citep{balsamo1988life,lara19933620}). These differences among life cycles have usually been related to the limited resources available for an individual in its environment and how it allocates them \citep{stearns2000life}. Humans pose an interesting case regarding its life cycle due to the short reproductive period in comparison to their long lifespan, framed within long juvenile and post-reproductive stages \citep{kaplan2000theory}. Within these boundaries, humans present a high diversity in their life cycle with populations where life spans are long and their reproductive output is low (e.g. post-demographic transition Japan \citep{de2017maximum}) while others have short lifespans and high reproductive output (e.g. pygmies populations \citep{migliano2007life}). The diversity in the female human life cycle has also been associated with resource availability, specially in terms of longevity \citep{kaplan2003embodied}; while for fertility the relationship is more complex \citep{mulder1998demographic,sear2016understanding}. However, the ways in which resource availability relates to the diversity of the female human life cycle remain unclear. Human sociality surrounding resource availability (i.e. resource-related mechanisms) may be key to understand how the female human life cycle has evolved and diversified. Hence, the amount of resources an individual receives or gives from/to others (i.e. resource transfer) in different stages of their life cycle might explain the differences in developmental, reproductive, and mortality timing. Furthermore, the interplay of resource transfers with other resource-related mechanisms (i.e. resource production, consumption, and accumulation) could bring a better framework to understand the mechanisms by which resource availability links with the life cycle. Finally, there might be differences in the resource-related mechanisms depending on the type of resources (i.e. material, embodied, relational) and how they interplay, which could explain the diversity of the female human life cycle.
\\\\
Life history theory is the main framework used to understand the life cycle of an organism and its diversity across the tree of life,  from an evolutionary perspective. Life history theory aims to explain the differences in the survival, reproduction, growth, and development of organisms based on a differentiated individual allocation of resources depending on environmental conditions (i.e. life-history trade-offs, \citep{stearns2000life}). Humans are no exception, and several studies in evolutionary anthropology have used this framework to understand the special features of the female human life cycle \citep{mace2000evolutionary,borgerhoff2012human}. The main life-history trade-offs that have been addressed in human populations are quantity vs quality of offspring, reproduction now vs later, and reproductive vs (extra) somatic investment \citep{hill1999life}. Quantity vs quality offspring trade-off refers to the trade-off an individual faces on either investing resources to have a large number of “low-quality” offspring or a few “high-quality” ones. The trade-off reproduce now vs later refers to the moment an individual faces to either postpone reproduction or not, mainly related to its probability to survive later in life. The trade-off between reproduction and (extra) somatic investment alludes to the allocation of resources an individual does towards its offspring or to its own survival and development. Among these trade-offs, the quantity versus quality offspring trade-off has received major attention by itself, leaving few space to analyse the possibility of an interplay of different life-history trade-offs and/or the role of other trade-offs as well \citep{lawson2016offspring}. Furthermore, this situation has led to address mainly the relationship between the amount of resources available and offspring production. This approach usually does not question how and when resources are available but focuses more on how much there are.
\\\\
Competition and cooperation have been used to address how and when the sociality around resource availability may influence the life history trade-offs an individual faces across its life cycle \citep{cant2008reproductive,kramer2005children}. On the one hand, studies on competitive dynamics have focused on reproductive conflict, where intrasexual competition is high between generations \citep{mace2012female,lahdenpera2012severe} and co-residency patterns \citep{pettay2016costly}. Also, sibling competition has been studied in humans, by addressing how the competition among the offspring of an individual influences resource allocation and parent fitness \citep{lawson2009trade}. An example can be seen in rural Ethiopia where land inheritance may increase competition, decreasing productivity and reproductive success of younger siblings \citep{gibson2011land}. On the other hand, the relationship of cooperation and the female human life cycle has been framed within the cooperative breeding model, where individuals other than parents help rearing their offspring \citep{hrdy2007evolutionary}. Evidence has been found in rural Ireland, where siblings would suppress their reproduction to take care of the land for the older sibling that is inheriting the land \citep{strassmann1998ecological} while in Mayan and Pumé population infant care is shared between the mother (57\%) and other relatives (43\%) \citep{kramer2018infant}. Most likely, elements of competition and cooperation coexist in human populations, depending on such factors as resource availability \citep{mulder2007hamilton} or genetic relatedness \citep{strassmann2011cooperation}. 
\\\\
Despite the large amount of research done within the competition/cooperation dichotomy, there is no consensus regarding the influence of competitive and cooperative dynamics in the female human life cycle, due to methodological and theoretical issues. Methodologically, there is a high variety of outcome variables used in these studies that are not standardized and makes it difficult to compare results between studies and populations (e.g. compare   individual survival with number of surviving offspring or child anthropometrics) \citep{brown2002reconsidering}. Additionally, many studies use kin presence to address competitive or cooperative dynamics depending on the direction of the relationship between the kin member and the life-history trait of interest (negative = competition and positive = cooperation) \citep{sear2011much}, leaving in a black box the mechanisms that could explain these relationships. Theoretically, the lack of consensus has lead to the development of multiple models trying to explain the female human life cycle, such as the embodied capital model - or its more specific formulation, the pooled energy budget model - to explain the long juvenile period \citep{kaplan2000theory,kramer2010pooled}; the cooperative breeding model to explain the large number of offspring and short interbirth intervals \citep{kramer2005children}; or the grandmother hypothesis to explain the post-reproductive lifespan \citep{hawkes2013grandmothers}. This scenario has led to multiple hypotheses of the relationship between competition/cooperation and the female human life cycle, focusing only on specific stages of the life cycle. Related to this last point, many of these models and research do not consider the influence of social interactions in early stages of the life cycle, leaving out of the equation the possibility that what can be seen in one stage can be reversed or compensated at a later stage \citep{mulder1998demographic}. Therefore, there is a need for unifying life-history, demographic, and sexual selection models to understand the black box in which resource availability and the female human life cycle are linked, behind the curtains of cooperation and competition.
\\\\
Resource transfers, understood as the social interactions where an individual gives or receives a resource, might be a starting point to understand the sociality around resource availability and its relationship with the female human life cycle. In other species, resource transfers, such as food provisioning and alloparenting in meerkats \citep{clutton2016meerkats}, territorial defense and predator detection in acorn woodpecker \citep{koenig2019does}, and bequeathal in kangaroo rats \citep{jones1986survivorship} have been associated with variations in the survival and reproductive dynamics of an individual life cycle. For humans, it has been suggested that resource transfers are crucial to understand the survival timing in the female human life cycle, with high early mortality and post-reproductive lifespan \citep{lee2003rethinking,lee2008sociality,chu2006co}. Resource transfers might also be crucial in the reproductive timing of humans, where they not only relate to offspring survival until sexual maturity via alloparenting, but also to transfers that might enhance the mating success of the offspring (e.g. bridewealth) \citep{jones2015resource}. Hence, disentangling how resource transfers shape an individual life cycle could help to understand the role of social interactions in the evolution of human survival, reproductive, and developmental timing.
\\\\
The black box linking resource availability with the female human life cycle does not only consist of resource transfers but also of other resource-related mechanisms such as production, consumption, and accumulation. Resource production and consumption have been the main mechanisms that have been studied, where the ability of producing more than what is consumed during adulthood could explain the long juvenile and post-reproductive periods \citep{kaplan2000theory}. Kaplan and collaborators also suggest that the high amount of resource production has been associated with the human ability of having short interbirth intervals, leading to a high reproductive output in short reproductive lifespans. Additionally, human resource transfers can lead to the accumulation of resources through several generations (e.g. land, body weight, social status) \citep{mulder2009intergenerational}. These kinds of mechanisms have led to propose that the resource accumulation of a human in one life cycle can influence fitness benefits for itself, its offspring, grand-offspring, and beyond \citep{rogers1990evolutionary,boone1999more,goodman2012low}. Thus, the interplay of resource transfers with production, consumption, and accumulation might be a good framework to understand the black box in which resource availability influences the life-history tactic of an individual.
\\\\
However, the relationship of resource-related mechanisms with the female human life cycle might also vary depending on the type of resource available. Research on resource-related mechanisms linking with variations in the female human life cycle have mainly focused on material resources due to evidence that economic conditions may mediate reproductive behaviour \citep{shenk2013model}. However, there is also evidence that embodied resources also played a role in the evolution of the female human life cycle, such as the role of parental educational level, and their investment in the education of their offspring, in variations on the reproductive behaviour of the descendants \citep{kaplan1996theory,snopkowski2014synthetic,snopkowski2016pathways}. Furthermore, relational resources seem to also play a role in the female human life cycle, where the role of social status and prestige across generations may be crucial to understand reproductive and survival variations \citep{boone1999more,shenk2016status}. An example can be seen in Agta and BaYaka hunter-gatherers, where women with high relational resources also present high fertility \citep{chaudhary2016competition,page2017hunter}. Few attempts have been made to understand the interplay of these types of resources and how they influence the female human life cycle, as can be seen in Mpimbwe population where material and relational resources may be more important than embodied resources to ensure child survival \citep{mulder2011understanding}. Hence, the paths by which resource availability influences the female human life cycle might not only depend on the sociality but also on the type of resource available.
\\\\
In conclusion, this project aims to understand how and when the sociality surrounding resource availability shapes the female human life cycle evolution, and how these relationships vary with different types of resources at different stages of life. Hence, the research questions of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How the resource transfers across the life cycle of an individual influences its life-history strategy?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In a juvenile stage, an individual would receive a large amount of resources. However, as the individual stays experience a large amount of beneficial resource transfers that would decrease with age, while costly ones would increase.
        \item The individual would reach sexual maturity if reaching adulthood would increase the beneficial transfers, making more resources available. Costly transfers would increase because of age.
        \item Once in a reproductive stage, an individual would have an offspring either when the increase of costly transfers associated with reproduction are covered by beneficial resource transfers or if the survival of the individual is low.
        \item A post-reproductive stage would start once the beneficial resource transfers would not be able to buffer the costly ones associated with another offspring but could ensure the survival of the individual. Costly resource transfers would continue to increase with age.
    \end{itemize}
\item How the relationship of resource transfers with resource production, consumption, and accumulation shape the female human life cycle?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During a juvenile stage, beneficial resource transfers and accumulation would play a major role since growth and development are crucial to prepare for later stages of the life cycle.
        \item The transition to a reproductive stage would happen if that would increase resources available, adding the ones coming from resource production to those via beneficial resource transfers.
        \item An individual would have an offspring once the costs of reproduction can be covered by resource production, and buffered by the consumption of accumulated resources and beneficial resource transfers.
        \item The transition to a post-reproductive stage would happen if the amount of produced resources and the buffering effect of resource accumulation and resource transfers cannot cover the costs of having another offspring but can ensure the individual survival. Therefore, the possible surplus of resources could be costly transfers or accumulated.
    \end{itemize}
\item How the relationship of resource-related mechanisms with the female human life cycle changes depending on the interplay of material, embodied, and relational resources?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Material resource-related mechanisms would play the main role across the life cycle, and oscillations of them are buffered by embodied and relational ones. Embodied resource-related mechanisms would influence more than relational ones during a juvenile stage, since growth and development are crucial in this stage of life. 
        \item The transition to a reproductive stage would be related to an increase of material and relational  related mechanisms.
        \item Once sexual maturity is reached, an individual would have an offspring once the costs of reproduction can be covered by material related mechanisms, and if these are not enough, they are covered by relational ones first, and embodied ones afterwards. 
        \item An individual would transit to a post-reproductive stage if the interplay of material, embodied, and relational resource mechanisms cannot cover the costs of having another offspring but can ensure the individual survival.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

A combination of the life-history theoretical framework and the economic models of resource transfers is an ideal approach to understand the coevolution of the female human life cycle and the sociality associated with resource availability. Research towards this direction has led to the integration of life-history models with economic resource transfers, leading to a consensus that reproducion behaviour might be primarily driven by economic decisions \citep{jones2015resource}. \cite{lee2003rethinking} developed a model that suggests that age-specific mortality is proportional to the remaining reproductive value and resource transfers made at later ages, predicting the early-life and later-life mortality patterns characteristics of the female human life cycle. \cite{chu2006co} model shows that if productivity increases with age, then individuals are able to borrow across the life cycle due to resource transfers. Finally, the pooled energy model suggests that intergenerational resource transfers would allow to decrease the load of parental investment via alloparenting from individuals at different stages of their life cycles \citep{kramer2010pooled}. All of these models consider resource production and consumption to address the mechanisms relating resource availability with different life-history traits, while transfers and accumulation are indirectly covered. Most of these models do not account for random variation among individuals (i.e. individual stochasticity), despite being a major component in reproductive variation \citep{van2017lifetime}. Additionally, most models are designed to avoid values that resemble loss (e.g. zeros), which would be leading to a bias since individuals in those models would not be able to compensate further in time these losses that might be unavoidable at certain stages of the life cycle (Price and Jones, 2020). Finally, these models do not address different types of resources, being impossible to acknowledge the differences among material, embodied, and relational resource-related mechanisms and the female human life cycle \citep{mulder2009intergenerational}.
\\\\
Dynamic state variable models might be a modelling approach able to tackle the issues pending from previous models. These models account for the current stage of an individual and its possible changes according to the actions and environment of an individual, allowing to analyse the optimal individual behaviour and the different trade-offs behind its variation considering the stage-specific constraints of the individual \citep{houston1988dynamic,clark2000dynamic}. Dynamic state variable models have been used before to explain human behaviour such as in Oregon fisheries, where the model predicted the probabilities of high-grading during a fishing trip depending on the time of the trip, trip quota, risk of trip termination, and fish mortality \citep{gillis1995dynamic}. Furthermore, this approach was used by \cite{anderies1996adaptive} to predict maximization of interbirth intervals among !Kung women by including mortality schedules, backload and foraging success. Also, \cite{luttbeg2000marry} used this approach to understand if Kipsigis men decide to marry or not in order to maximize the number of offspring or the amount of wealth they can transfer to them, based on the value of livestock, number of wives and children, and amount of land. Therefore, a dynamic state variable model may allow to understand the variations on the life-history trajectory of an individual depending on the resources available, and the ways it is available, at some point of life.
\\\\
Finally, longitudinal data containing information on the timing of the different life-history traits of an individual as well as resource transfers experienced across its life cycle would be necessary to test dynamic state variable models. This kind of data would tackle the interest of this project on the timing of resource-related mechanisms in the female human life cycle because it would contain information on the ways resources availability  varies through the life-history of an individual. The data should also contain information on the different types of resources in order to tackle differences in the relationship between resource availability and the female human life cycle. For this, resources would be divided mainly in material, embodied, and relational following the evidence linking these types of resources to inequality and child survival \citep{mulder2009intergenerational,mulder2011understanding}.
